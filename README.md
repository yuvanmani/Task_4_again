I used dropdown menu to show the transaction types like income/expense as per your comments.
I am a beginner in Software field.
I have tried my level best with respect to my experience.
I fixed the edit button & function to edit the transaction.
The edit function is working partially. Beyond this i couldn't fix it.
Please consider this. I will learn it in the upcoming classes.

This app is designed to calculate the income & expense values.
We need to enter the income amount in positive values in the input field.
Enter the expenses as negative value.
We can delete the entries, if we don't want it.
The modification in entries will reflect in the total values.
