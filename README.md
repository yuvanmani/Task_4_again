I am a beginner in Software field.
I have tried my level best with respect to my experience.
I used dropdown menu to select the transaction types like income/expense as per your comments.
I fixed the edit button & function to edit the transaction.
The edit function is working partially. Beyond this I couldn't fix it.
Please consider this. I am upskilling my skills & will give my maximum efforts in the upcoming tasks.

This app is designed to calculate the income & expense values.
We need to enter the income amount in positive values in the input field.
Enter the expenses as negative value.
We can delete the entries, if we don't want it.
The modification in entries will reflect in the total values.
