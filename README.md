I used dropdown menu instead of radio button to show the transaction types like income/expense, because of the comment which i got in the previous deployment.
This app is designed to calculate the income & expense values.
We need to enter the income amount in positive values in the input field.
Enter the expenses as negative value.
We can delete the entries, if we don't want it.
The modification in entries will reflect in the total values.
I tried to fix the local storage, but i couldn't fix it properly.
